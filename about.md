I'm a PhD student at the [Swiss AI Lab IDSIA](http://www.idsia.ch/idsia_en.html) under the supervision of [JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/). 

My main research interest is in Artificial Intelligence, where I focus on Machine Learning with Artificial Neural Networks. I'm specifically interested in systematic generalisation and learning structured representations from an environment or data with a large complexity due to a combinatorial explosion. I believe that improvements in that area will bring us closer to human-level intelligence.

My academic background is in Computer Science with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of St Andrews (Scotland) and a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland. More information can be found in my [CV](/imanol.schlag.cv.pdf).
