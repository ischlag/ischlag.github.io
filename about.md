I'm a PhD student at the [Swiss AI Lab IDSIA](http://www.idsia.ch/idsia_en.html) under the supervision of [Jürgen Schmidhuber](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/). 

My main research interest is in Artificial Intelligence, where I focus on Machine Learning with Artificial Neural Networks. I’m interested in the systematic generalisation of neural networks. To this end, I’m investigating the networks ability to learn structured representations that enable algebraic compositionality. My most recent work augments a recurrent neural network with fast weights such that it learns to reason form natural language question-answer pairs.

My academic background is in Computer Science with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of St Andrews (Scotland) and a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland. More information can be found in my [CV](/imanol.schlag.cv.pdf).
